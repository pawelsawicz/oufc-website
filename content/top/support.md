The rising costs of coaching, equipment, and generally the increasing cost of student life in Oxford does take a heavy toll on the extent to which our members can fence. In order to offer our members the opportunity to pursue their goals in fencing, we would like to subsidise as much as possible all activities that will enable our fencers to attain that high level of achievement which OUFC has been proud of since 1891.

We would like to appeal to our former members, who have enjoyed in the past the benefits and team spirit which OUFC has been able to give them, to support the future of our club by making a donation.

To facilitate this process we are working with the Oxford University Development Office, which is in charge of collecting the donations on our behalf. This enables the Club to reclaim, from HMRC, an additional 25% on top of any donation made by a UK tax payer. Moreover, if you are a higher-rate taxpayer you can also claim tax relief of 25%. You can download the necessary forms to make a donation directly from this webpage. For any further information on donations and tax benefits you can contact the treasurer, or the Oxford University Development Office directly at sport@devoff.ox.ac.uk.

 

Oxford Thinking
Oxford University have launched up a centralised system for donations to clubs and societies. This is the easiest way for you to make a donation if you are interested as it allows online debit/credit card transfers. To donate to the fencing club, please visit this page. If you would prefer to donate by cheque, see below.

 

Forms for offline donations
Donation form: this form enables you to make a donation to the OUFC through the Development Office. This can be done by cheque, bank transfer or Direct Debit. Donations can be made on a one-off basis or on a regular (monthly, quarterly, yearly) basis. If you wish to make a donation equivalent to the yearly membership fee for our members, the sum is currently Â£80. This form also allows the Club to obtain Gift Aid from HMRC. Please return all forms directly to the Oxford University Development Office, as indicated at the bottom of the form.
